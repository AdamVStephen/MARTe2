/**
 * @brief Implementation of streamable type functions.
 *
 * Implementation of streamable type functions for read, write and seek operations in buffered and unbuffered modes for streamable types
 * i.e files. Most of the functions depends from the virtual UnBuffered functions which must be implemented in the derived classes
 * because could be differents for different streamable types.
 *
 * DoubleBufferedStream uses two IOBuffer in buffered modes, one for reading and one for writing operations and they are used togheter if the stream is defined as
 * readable, writable and seekable.*/

/**
 * @brief DoubleBufferedStream class.

 Replaces CStream and Streamable of BL1
 Inherits from pure virtual StreamInterface and does not resolve all pure virtual functions

 Uses the following StreamInterface methods to operate:
 CanRead  Read
 CanWrite Write
 CanSeek  Seek
 But only allows using GetC and PutC as it masks the whole StreamInterface
 To use the whole StreamInterface one needs to implement safe versions of
 all functions. This is left for for further class derivations.

 Note also that this class supports partially or fully disabled buffering.
 Just set the buffer size to 0 and the buffer to NULL.

 It is a buffering mechanism for character streams
 It operates in 6 modes (+variants) depending on the Stream capabilities
 CanSeek CanRead CanWrite
 and user Buffering choices

 1) Separate Buffering Output Mode
 CanWrite !CanSeek
 Used for devices where in and out streams are separate (for instance console )
 writeBuffer.Buffer()!=NULL && operatingMode.MutexBuffering() = false
 !Can be combined with Separate Buffering Input Mode
 1a) writeBuffer.Buffer()== NULL just call directly StreamInterface::Write

 2) Separate buffering Input Mode
 CanRead  !CanSeek
 Used for devices where in and out streams are separate (for instance console )
 readBuffer.Buffer()!=NULL  &&  operatingMode.mutexBuffering = false
 !Can be combined with Separate Buffering Output Mode
 2a) readBuffer.Buffer()== NULL just call directly StreamInterface::Read

 3) Dual separate buffers Input and Output Mode
 CanRead CanWrite !CanSeek
 Mode 1/1a and 2/2a combined

 4) Joint buffering Mode
 CanRead CanWrite CanSeek
 readBuffer.Buffer()!=NULL  && writeBuffer.Buffer()!=NULL &&
 operatingMode.mutexBuffering() = true
 operatingMode.mutexWriteMode and
 operatingMode.mutexReadMode  determines whether the read
 or write buffering is active
 Get and Put toggle the two flags
 everytime the flags are changed a proper Flush operation is
 triggered to clean the buffers
 4a-b) one of readBuffer or writeBuffer is NULL
 same toggling of flags and flushing

 5) Joint buffering Read Only Mode
 CanRead !CanWrite CanSeek
 readBuffer.Buffer()!=NULL  && writeBuffer.Buffer()==NULL &&
 operatingMode.mutexBuffering() = false
 Operates identically to mode 2 but cannot be active together
 with mode 6
 5a) same as 2a

 6) Joint buffering Write Only Mode
 !CanRead CanWrite CanSeek
 readBuffer.Buffer()==NULL  && writeBuffer.Buffer()!=NULL &&
 operatingMode.mutexBuffering() = false
 Operates identically to mode 1 but cannot be active together
 with mode 5
 6a) same as 1a
