/**
 * @brief Abstract super class for all buffered streams.
 *
 * @details This class provides the common interface specification for all the
 * streams which support buffering.
 *
 * The stream represents a sequence of bytes which can be mapped to arrays,
 * strings, files, sockets, and so on, but that it can be accessed uniformly
 * using a common read/write interface. A stream is also meant to be able to
 * have the notion of cursor, which can be positioned randomly on any byte of
 * the stream; size, which allows to know the actual size of the stream; and
 * timeout, which allows to define a time out for read and write operations,
 * so they will not last for ever in case of I/O problems. Moreover, the
 * stream have implicit reading and writing buffers which are expected to be
 * defined by subclasses of the stream, but used by upper level functions
 * like read or write.
 *
 * Attributes:
 * - Size: The size of the stream, i.e. the number of bytes that it holds.
 * - Position: The position of the cursor, i.e. the zero-based index of the
 *   byte where the next read/write operation will occur.
 * - Timeout: It is the time out for read and write operations, infinite
 *   by default.
 * - ReadBuffer: It is the buffer for reading data, which will be used by
 *   the specific implementations of the read function.
 * - WriteBuffer: It is the buffer for writing data, which will be used by
 *   the specific implementations of the write function.
 *
 * Operators:
 * - AnyType()
 *
 * Operations:
 * - Read
 * - Write
 * - Seek
 * - Copy (*)
 * - GetToken (*)
 * - SkipTokens (*)
 * - GetLine (*)
 * - Printf (*)
 * - PrintFormatted (*)
 *
 * (*) The class supplies a standard implementation for these operations.
 *
 * @warning The generic capabilities for reading, writing, and seeking can not
 * assured to be available on all kind of mapped streams, so an additional set
 * of "CanXXX" methods will advise the user what can be done with the stream.
 *
 * - CanRead: Queries if the stream is readable, i.e. if the operation Read
 *   is implemented.
 * - CanWrite: Queries if the stream is writable, i.e. if the operation Write
 *   is implemented.
 * - CanSeek: Queries if the stream is seekable, i.e. if the operations Seek
 *   and RelativeSeek are implemented.
 *
 * @warning The size and position attributes can be meaningless in some kind
 * of mapped streams, so in these cases, size and position will be set to the
 * maximum value of uint64. This also implies that operations like read and
 * write, which increments position and/or size, will saturate them at the
 * maximum value on these cases.
