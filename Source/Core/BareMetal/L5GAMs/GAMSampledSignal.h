 *     Cycles = "how many consecutive cycles the variable must be be read or write"
 *     Samples = "the samples blocks to e read or write"

     * The field "Samples" is a string expressing a nx3 matrix and each vector defines a block of samples to be read (write).
     * In particular in each vector "{a , b , c}" define the following two sample fractional indexes: a/c and b/c, where a/c is the
     * oldest sample to read and b/c is the most recent sample to read, in ascending order with zero being the most recent.
     * Let N = DataSourceSignal::GetNumberOfSamples() be the total number of samples in a signal S, where S[N-1] is the most recent sample.
     * Then, the following operation will be applied to access the specified samples of the S[N-(a/c)*N:N-(b/c)*N-1]\n
     * As an example, let N = 1000 and Samples = "{{1 , 0 , 2},{10, 9, 10}}"
     * In this case, the following signal will be read in runtime: s = { S(500), S(501), ... , S(999), S(0), ... , S(99) },
     * where S(i) denotes the i-th sample.\n
     * By default, if this field is not specified, the last sample produced will be read (write).
