 * For each GAM signal, the signal name is searched in the provided DataSourceI (see Init) and, for each of the two buffers,
 *  the memory address of the variable containing the address of the signal is retrieved using the GetSignalMemoryBuffer function.
 *  The idea is that the DataSource can change this variable value (and thus the place to where it is pointing) and as a consequence
 *  the Broker will be able to read/write from this different location with minimum penalty on performance.
 *  The information of each element to be copied is stored in a MemoryMapStatefulBrokerCopyTableEntry.
