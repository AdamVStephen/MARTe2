     *
     *   - Path = "the address of the DataSourceSignalI object producing/consuming this signal" (default "")\n
     *   - Type = "the variable type" (default "")\n
     *   - Default = "the variable default value" (default "")\n
     *   - Dimensions = "the variable dimensions" (default "")\n
     *   - Operation = "the read-write operation configuration parameters" (default "")\n
     *   - Cycles = "how many subsequent cycles the variable must read or write"
     *
     * The "Dimensions" parameter follows the same format of the operation string in IntrospectionEntry. In particular in this
     * case Dimensions = "[n]" denotes an array with n elements, "Dimensions" = "[n][m]" denotes a matrix with n rows and m columns.\n
     * The "Operation" string allows to perform . The most common syntax for this variable is the expression of a nx2 matrix specifying in each row
     * the begin and the end indexes of the block to be read (write) from (to) the RealTimeDataSourceSignal. An example is
     *
     *     Operation = "{{0,2},{9,9}}"
     *
     * which means that the reader (writer) must read (write) the first three elements of the DataSourceSignal block and then the 10-th element
     * to (from) the GAM signal variable.
     * Obviously in this case the GAMSignal must have a dimension of at least four elements (this will be checked during the configuration
     * of the DataSourceBroker).With this syntax a MemoryMapInputReader (MemoryMapOutputWriter) can be returned from the DataSource (if supported).
     * Most of DataSources (like DynamicDataBuffer) supports this syntax for this operation type.\n
     * The "Cycles" field can specify if the variable has to be read (write) in synchronous or asynchronous mode. In particular if it is equal to zero the
     * signal will be read (write) from (to) the data source asynchronously. Conversely, if this field is greater than zero the the specified number
     * of cycles of the signal will be read (write) synchronously from the data source and stored in memory. For instance, suppose that the goal is to
     * read three cycles of the integer X. The signal returned will be the array { X(1) , X(2) , X(3) } where X(i) denotes the integer read at the i-th cycle.\n
     * It is possible combine "Cycles" with "Operation" and "Samples" field (the latter available only for GAMSampledSignal) to define a specific IO
     * operation.

     * @param[in] data contains the configuration data.
     * @return false in case of errors, true otherwise.
