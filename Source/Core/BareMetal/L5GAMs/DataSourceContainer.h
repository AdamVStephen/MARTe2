     * GAMSignalI and retrieves the path (GAMSignalI.GetPath) of the signal. Search for this path
     * inside each of the DataSource elements of this DataSourceContainer and checks if any of the found Reference is of type DataSourceSignalI.
     * If so then there is a match and the GAMSignalI is added to the found DataSourceSignalI either as a consumer (DataSourceSignalI.AddConsumer if this
     * GAMSignalI is an input to the GAM) or as a producer (DataSourceSignalI.AddProducer if this GAMSignalI is an output of the GAM). This is the typical
     * of GAMs which share signals directly with DataSource (i.e. drivers).
     *
     * If the path is not found and the GAMSignalI is not of type GAMSampledSignal then a new DataSourceSignal is created and added to the
     * DataSource specified in the path. This is the typical of GAMs which share signals between them.
     *
     * Finally two signals are automatically added to a DataSource named GAM_Times. The first signal is named GAM_NAME.AbsoluteUsecTime and the
     * second signal is named GAM_NAME.RelativeUsecTime, where GAM_NAME is the value returned by GAM::GetName. Both signals are of type uint64. The
