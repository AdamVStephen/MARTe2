 * @brief Class responsible for the orchestration of a MARTe real-time application.
 * @details This is the main class of any MARTe real-time application. It is a container of
 * Functions (GAMGroup or GAM), States (RealTimeState), Data (RealTimeDataSourceContainer) and
 * Scheduler references. This class is responsible for validating the global configuration and
 * for verifying that the application is complete (i.e. that not only each reference is valid
 * but that also cross-dependencies between references are also valid, e.g. there is at least
 * one producer for every data signal data is produced).
 *
 * The syntax in the configuration stream should be:
 *
 * RealTimeApplication_name = {\n
 *     Class = RealTimeApplication\n
 *     +Functions = {\n
 *         Class = ReferenceContainer\n
 *         GAM_name = {\n
 *             Class = GAM\n
 *             ...\n
 *         }\n
 *         GAM_Group_name = {\n
 *             Class = GAMGroup\n
 *             ...\n
 *         }\n
 *         ...\n
 *     }\n
 *     +States = {\n
 *         Class = ReferenceContainer\n
 *         State_name = {\n
 *             Class = RealTimeState\n

 *                 Class = RealTimeThread\n
 *                 ...\n

 *             ...\n
 *         }\n
 *         ...\n

 *         IsFinal = true v false\n
