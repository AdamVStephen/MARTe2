 * @details These methods allows to store and remove pointers to threadInformation objects. A new entry is automatically
 * add to the database when a thread begin its execution and it's removed from database automatically when the
 * thread terminate. An internal mutex could be implemented here to make consistent all operations on database between
 * threads. The database allows to threads the access to other threads informations.
 *
 * @details Most of the implementation is delegated to ThreadsDatabaseOS because there are OS which implements most
 * of these functions natively. It is possible define the memory granularity (the size allocated in each allocation function)
 * changing the value of THREADS_DATABASE_GRANULARITY in GeneralDefinitionsOS.h for each operating system.
