 * memory areas.
 *
 * @details Most of the implementation is delegated to MemoryOS.h which provides system calls for the
 * memory management that are different for each operating system.
 *
 * @details These methods are particularly useful in the implementation of functionality that requires
 * a dynamic management of the memory, like for example databases, static lists, streams ecc.

 * @brief Implementation of functions for heap memory management.
 *
 * @details These functions allows to allocate and free memory portions dynamically on the heap. It is possible use different functionalities using the flags
 * defined in MemoryAllocationFlags enumeration.\n
 * - MemoryStandardMemory: is the default flag and imposes that the memory to be allocated is minor than 32Mb.\n
 * - MemoryExtraMemory: allows to allocate more than 32Mb.\n
 *
 * If the symbol MEMORY_STATISTIC is defined:
 *
 * The informations related to the heap memory allocated by a fixed number of threads
 * are stored in a database (MemoryStatisticsDatabase). The maximum number of elements in the database is defined in GeneralDefinitionsOS.h
 * The informations about the memory allocated by a certain thread are accessible using Memory::AllocationStatistics function.
 *
 * Moreover an header which contains informations about the size and thread id who allocated the memory is created before each memory chunk.\n
 * These informations are accessible using Memory::GetHeaderInfo function.
 *
 * @details Most of the implementation is OS dependent and it is delegated to MemoryOS class in MemoryOS.h.
